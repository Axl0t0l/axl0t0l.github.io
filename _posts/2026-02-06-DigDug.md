## Challenge
> "*Oooh, turns out, this MACHINE_IP machine is also a DNS server! If we could dig into it, I am sure we could find some interesting records! But... it seems weird, this only responds to a special type of request for a givemetheflag.com domain?*"

## Walkthrough
### Recon
Always start with nmap scan, since we're looking for UDP based service we should use ```-sU``` flag. so final command is:

```bash
nmap -sC -sU -p 50-100 MACHINE_IP
```

> I only used ```-p``` flag in nmap to reduce the scanning time, otherwise you can scan normally.
{: .prompt-info }



### Solution Approach
> "*Retrieve the flag from the DNS server!*"


Hmm looks we have DNS server at port 53 lets use nslookup to check its TXT records!

```bash
nslookup -type=txt givemetheflag.com MACHINE_IP
```

and Tatadaa!
